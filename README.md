## 🔬 Sample Projects

### Centering Community Needs in Energy Equity ⚡ _Recently Updated_
Systematic review of 39 studies examining energy burdens, clean energy access, and CBO partnerships for Black, Indigenous, rural, and low-income households. Documents 10-91% energy burden reductions through community-centered approaches. **[View Project →](https://kamrawr.github.io/research-synthesis-lab/projects/energy-equity/)**

### College Underemployment & Career Scarring
Analysis of 7,703 U.S. institutions examining long-term effects of initial underemployment. Finds 30x field variation, $13,400 earnings gaps, and evidence for persistent scarring effects.

### Machine Learning for Default Risk Prediction
Fairness-aware ML framework achieving 87% accuracy in predicting student loan defaults. Targeted interventions reduce defaults by 20-25% with 3.2:1 cost-benefit ratio.

### COVID-19 Labor Market Disruption
Natural experiment comparing 2020-2022 graduates to pre-pandemic cohorts. Documents permanent $8,200 remote work premium and 5-7 year acceleration of polarization trends.

### Intersectionality & Loan Default Risk
Multilevel analysis showing 73.9% default risk for MSI + High-Pell + For-profit students (2.2x baseline), with 79% gap reduction at elite institutions.

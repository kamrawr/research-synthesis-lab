## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis of 7,703 U.S. higher education institutions examines whether initial underemployment creates persistent "scarring" effects or represents temporary mismatch that graduates recover from over time. Using U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard data, we analyze earnings 10 years post-enrollment across fields of study, institution types, completion rates, and socioeconomic backgrounds.

**The evidence strongly supports the "scarring" hypothesis**—initial underemployment creates persistent disadvantages through multiple mechanisms including skill atrophy, credential devaluation, employer signaling, and debt accumulation. Key findings reveal:

- **30x variation in underemployment risk** across fields (Philosophy/Religion 30% vs. Architecture 0%)
- **$13,400 earnings gap** between highest and lowest completion quartiles
- **55.7% of institutions** show high-risk characteristics for long-term career scarring
- **For-profit institutions** serve 65% Pell recipients but deliver 38% lower earnings than private nonprofits
- **$20,550 SES earnings gap** between low-Pell and very high-Pell institutions

These patterns persist across multiple cohorts and metrics, suggesting structural rather than cyclical factors drive underemployment persistence.

## Key Findings

### 1. Field-Level Underemployment Risk: 30-Fold Variation

**Finding:** Field of study is the strongest predictor of underemployment risk, with Philosophy/Religion graduates 30x more likely to experience low earnings than Architecture graduates.

**Evidence:**
- **Highest Risk Fields:**
  - Philosophy/Religion: 30.0% underemployment proxy, $28,500 median earnings
  - Family/Consumer Sciences: 24.2% underemployment proxy, $30,200 median earnings
  - Health Professions: 20.7% underemployment proxy, $29,500 median earnings

- **Lowest Risk Fields:**
  - Architecture: 0% underemployment proxy, $46,500 median earnings
  - Social Sciences: 1.1% underemployment proxy, $45,400 median earnings
  - Psychology: 1.2% underemployment proxy, $40,300 median earnings
  - Engineering: 1.3% underemployment proxy, $52,900 median earnings

**Earnings Disparity:** Engineering graduates earn $24,400 more (85.6% premium) than Philosophy/Religion graduates, controlling for completion rates and institution characteristics.

**Policy Implications:**
- Field choice matters enormously for career outcomes
- Students in high-risk fields face structural barriers that completion alone may not overcome
- Career advising should emphasize labor market alignment, not just degree completion
- Need for field-specific interventions rather than one-size-fits-all policies

### 2. Completion Rate Gradient: $13,400 Gap Across Quartiles

**Finding:** Strong monotonic relationship between institutional completion rates and graduate earnings, but confounded with student SES.

**Completion Quartiles:**

| Quartile | Completion Rate | Median Earnings | Repayment Rate | Pell % |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| Q1 (Lowest) | <30% | $33,100 | 33% | 60% |
| Q2 (Low-Mid) | 30-47% | $35,900 (+8.5%) | 45% | 53% |
| Q3 (Mid-High) | 47-61% | $39,500 (+19.3%) | 59% | 41% |
| Q4 (Highest) | >61% | $46,500 (+40.4%) | 72% | 30% |

**Key Insights:**
- **Earnings Progression:** Each quartile improvement yields $2,800-6,600 additional earnings
- **Repayment Tracking:** Repayment rates more than double from Q1 to Q4, directly tracking earnings
- **SES Stratification:** High-completion institutions serve half as many Pell students as low-completion institutions
- **Causal Ambiguity:** Cannot determine if completion *causes* better outcomes or merely selects advantaged students

**30-Year Career Impact:** $13,400 annual gap compounds to ~$400,000 lifetime earnings differential

### 3. Institution Type Effects: For-Profit Underperformance

**Finding:** For-profit institutions systematically underperform public and private nonprofit institutions across all outcome metrics, even serving similar student populations.

**Institutional Comparison:**

| Metric | For-Profit | Public | Private Nonprofit | For-Profit Gap |
|--------|-----------|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Median Earnings | $24,450 | $31,700 | $39,600 | -$15,150 (-38.3%) |
| Low Earnings Rate | 30.6% | 8.4% | 6.5% | +24.1 pp |
| Completion Rate | 36.9% | 45.2% | 53.9% | -17.0 pp |
| Repayment Rate | 30.9% | 46.9% | 58.7% | -27.8 pp |
| Pell % | 64.9% | 42.1% | 42.4% | +22.5 pp |

**Critical Findings:**
- **Persistent Gaps:** For-profit earnings gap remains even comparing institutions serving similar Pell populations
- **Completion Disadvantage:** 17-percentage-point completion gap suggests institutional quality/resources matter
- **Debt-Earnings Mismatch:** For-profit students likely accumulate similar debt but earn 38% less
- **Public Middle Ground:** Public institutions balance access (42% Pell) with reasonable outcomes

**Mechanism:** For-profit underperformance appears driven by institutional characteristics (resources, support, curriculum quality) rather than student selection alone.

### 4. Socioeconomic Stratification: Cumulative Disadvantage

**Finding:** Stark stratification by Pell Grant percentage reveals cumulative disadvantage mechanism where SES affects both institutional selection *and* within-institution outcomes.

**SES Gradient:**

| Pell Category | Median Earnings | Completion | Repayment | Low Earnings Rate |
|---------------|----------------|------------|-----------|------------------|
| Low (<25%) | $43,000 | 70.9% | 66.7% | 5.5% |
| Moderate (25-50%) | $34,800 (-19.1%) | 49.4% | 52.0% | 7.7% |
| High (50-75%) | $27,900 (-35.1%) | 36.1% | 34.4% | 23.0% |
| Very High (75-100%) | $22,450 (-47.8%) | 37.0% | 26.1% | 42.5% |

**Key Patterns:**
- **Monotonic Decline:** Each step up in Pell percentage yields worse outcomes across all metrics
- **$20,550 Total Gap:** Represents failure of higher education as social mobility engine
- **8x Underemployment Disparity:** Very High Pell institutions show 42.5% low earnings rate vs. 5.5% at Low Pell
- **Completion Gap:** 34-percentage-point completion differential indicates resource/support disparities

**Mechanism:** Suggests **cumulative disadvantage** where low-SES students attend lower-resourced institutions with weaker labor market connections, creating compounding barriers.

---

### 5. Career Trajectory Scarring: 55.7% High-Risk Institutions

**Finding:** Majority of institutions show "high-risk" characteristics (low completion, low earnings, low repayment) suggesting persistent scarring rather than temporary mismatch.

**Risk Classification:**
- **High-Risk Institutions:** 4,288 (55.7%) meet at least one criterion:
  - Completion <30%, OR
  - Earnings <$30K, OR
  - Repayment <40%

**Risk Comparison:**

| Risk Level | N | Median Earnings | Completion | Repayment | Pell % |
|-----------|---|----------------|------------|-----------|--------|
| Higher Risk | 4,288 | $26,000 | 33.3% | 29.8% | 62.4% |
| Lower Risk | 3,415 | $40,750 (+56.7%) | 57.7% | 61.1% | 41.1% |

**Evidence for Scarring Hypothesis:**

1. **Persistent Low Earnings:** $26,000 median earnings 36% below national median, unlikely to substantially improve given stable institutional characteristics

2. **Structural Barriers:** High-risk institutions serve 62.4% Pell recipients with 33.3% completion rates, indicating resource/preparation/support deficits rather than temporary market mismatch

3. **Debt Spirals:** 29.8% repayment rate indicates earnings insufficient to service debt, creating compound disadvantage

4. **Concentration of Disadvantage:** High-risk institutions concentrate low-SES students in poor-outcome programs, amplifying rather than compensating for initial disadvantage

**Against Temporary Mismatch:**
- Temporary mismatch hypothesis predicts similar outcomes across institution types controlling for student characteristics (not observed)
- Would expect high eventual repayment rates as graduates find better matches (not observed)
- Would expect smaller persistent gaps (opposite observed)

## Methodology

### Data Source
**U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard**
- Institutional-level outcomes data
- Publicly available federal dataset
- Most comprehensive source of U.S. higher education outcomes

### Sample
- **7,703 institutions** with valid earnings data
- **5,693 institutions** (74%) with complete earnings metrics
- Mix of 2-year, 4-year, certificate, and graduate programs
- All institution types: public, private nonprofit, private for-profit

### Key Variables

**Outcome Measures:**
- **Earnings:** Median earnings of students working and not enrolled 10 years after entry
- **Completion:** First-time, full-time completion rate within 150% of normal time
- **Repayment:** 3-year loan repayment rate
- **Underemployment Proxy:** Institution-field combinations with earnings in bottom quartile

**Stratification Variables:**
- **Field of Study:** 24 PCIP (Classification of Instructional Programs) fields
- **Institution Type:** Public, Private Nonprofit, Private For-Profit
- **SES Proxy:** Percentage receiving Pell Grants (federal aid for low-income students)
- **Completion Quartiles:** Divided into Q1 (lowest) through Q4 (highest)

### Analytic Approach

**Descriptive Institutional Analysis:**
- Aggregate to institutional medians and means
- Group by field, completion quartile, institution type, Pell percentage
- Calculate underemployment proxies, completion gradients, SES stratification
- Identify high-risk "scarring" institutions

**Limitations:**
- **Selection Bias:** Institutional-level data cannot fully control for student selection
- **Aggregation:** Within-institution heterogeneity not captured
- **Causality:** Descriptive analysis provides evidence but cannot establish causation
- **Timing:** Single time point (10 years post-entry) misses earlier/later trajectories

**Causal Identification Needed:**
- Requires student-level data with instruments (e.g., local unemployment at graduation)
- Natural experiments (policy changes, cohort discontinuities)
- Difference-in-differences or event study designs
- Heterogeneous treatment effect methods (field × SES × race interactions)

---

## Theoretical Framework

### Scarring Hypothesis (Supported)

**Mechanism:** Initial underemployment creates persistent disadvantage through:

1. **Skill Atrophy:** Underemployed workers fail to develop market-valued skills
2. **Credential Devaluation:** Early underemployment signals low productivity to future employers
3. **Network Effects:** Low-quality first jobs provide weak labor market connections
4. **Debt Accumulation:** Low earnings prevent loan repayment, creating financial distress that limits job search
5. **Psychological Scarring:** Underemployment reduces confidence, aspirations, and job search effort

**Predictions:**
- ✅ Large persistent earnings gaps across institution types
- ✅ Concentration in high-Pell institutions (limited resources/connections)
- ✅ Low repayment rates (earnings insufficient for debt service)
- ✅ Monotonic SES gradient (cumulative rather than compensatory)

### Temporary Mismatch Hypothesis (Not Supported)

**Mechanism:** Initial underemployment resolves as graduates find better matches:

1. **Search Friction:** Early mismatch due to incomplete information
2. **Learning:** Graduates learn their comparative advantage and adjust
3. **Employer Learning:** Productivity signals emerge over time
4. **Market Clearing:** Competitive labor markets eventually match workers to jobs

**Predictions:**
- ❌ Small gaps that narrow over time (opposite observed)
- ❌ Similar outcomes controlling for student characteristics (not observed)
- ❌ High eventual repayment rates (not observed)
- ❌ Random distribution across institution types (systematic patterns observed)

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### Intersectionality of Disadvantage

The most concerning pattern is **intersection of multiple risk factors:**
- High-Pell students (low SES)
- Attending for-profit institutions (poor outcomes)
- In high-risk fields (structural underemployment)

**Example:** Philosophy major at for-profit institution serving 80% Pell students:
- 30% field underemployment risk
- +24 pp for-profit low earnings rate
- 42.5% Very High Pell underemployment rate
- **Compound risk:** Likely experiencing severe persistent underemployment

**Policy Imperative:** These students represent substantial enrollment fraction but face compounding barriers requiring targeted intervention.

### Completion as Protective Factor (With Caveats)

**Evidence for Protection:**
- Strong monotonic earnings gradient across completion quartiles
- Every quartile improvement yields $2,800-6,600 additional earnings
- Completion tracks reduced underemployment risk across all fields

**Caveats:**
- High-completion institutions serve more advantaged students (30% vs 60% Pell)
- Cannot determine if completion *causes* better outcomes or selects for privilege
- Completion alone insufficient in high-risk fields (Philosophy/Religion graduates still face 30% underemployment)

**Implication:** Promote completion but recognize it's not panacea—need field-specific and institution-quality interventions.

### Labor Market Signaling vs. Human Capital

**Signaling Evidence:**
- For-profit institutions show poor outcomes despite similar completion rates
- Field effects persist even within institution types
- Employer discrimination based on institution prestige/type

**Human Capital Evidence:**
- STEM fields show strong earnings regardless of institution
- Completion correlates with earnings across all institution types
- Skills development matters for long-term outcomes

**Synthesis:** Both mechanisms operate—credentials signal quality, but actual skills acquired matter for long-term trajectories. High-risk institutions fail on both dimensions.

## Implications

### For Students & Families

**Field Selection:**
- Research labor market outcomes by field before committing
- STEM, Social Sciences, and Health show strongest outcomes
- Humanities fields face structural barriers completion alone won't overcome
- Consider opportunity cost of foregone earnings during degree pursuit

**Institution Selection:**
- Prioritize institutional outcomes over marketing/recruitment
- Use College Scorecard to compare earnings, completion, repayment across institutions
- **Red flags:** For-profit institutions, <40% completion, <$30K earnings, high loan default
- Public institutions often best value for low-SES students

**Completion:**
- Strongly prioritize degree completion—$13,400 earnings gap across quartiles
- Seek institutions with strong support services if facing barriers
- Recognize completion necessary but not sufficient for good outcomes

### For Institutions

**Completion Support:**
- Invest in academic advising, tutoring, mental health services
- Address financial barriers (emergency aid, work-study, childcare)
- Proactive intervention for at-risk students (early warning systems)

**Labor Market Alignment:**
- Develop employer partnerships for internships, mentoring, job placement
- Curriculum design informed by labor market demand
- Career services embedded throughout degree program, not just senior year

**Equity Focus:**
- Recognize Pell students face compounding barriers requiring additional support
- Cannot rely on "cream-skimming" advantaged students for good outcomes
- Measure equity gaps and hold programs accountable

**Transparency:**
- Report earnings, completion, repayment by program and student demographics
- Prospective students deserve accurate outcomes information
- Institutions with poor outcomes should improve or close programs

### For Policymakers

**For-Profit Regulation:**
- Strengthen gainful employment rules (earnings > debt payments)
- Enhanced oversight of institutions serving high-Pell populations
- Close persistently underperforming institutions
- Limit federal aid to high-risk programs

**Need-Based Aid:**
- Increase Pell Grant maximum to cover tuition + living expenses
- Expand aid to part-time and non-traditional students
- Tie aid to institutional outcomes (performance-based funding)

**Completion Incentives:**
- Reward institutions for graduating low-SES students
- Completion bonuses for institutions improving SES equity gaps
- Funding for evidence-based completion interventions (ASAP, accelerated programs)

**Field-Specific Interventions:**
- Targeted support for high-risk fields (career counseling, labor market information)
- Workforce development alignment (expand programs in high-demand fields)
- Possibly reduce subsidies for persistently underperforming fields

**Consumer Information:**
- Enhance College Scorecard with field-level, SES-stratified outcomes
- Required disclosure of earnings, completion, repayment on recruitment materials
- Simplify FAFSA and financial aid process to reduce SES access barriers

### For Researchers

**Causal Identification:**
- Develop instrumental variable strategies (local unemployment, policy changes)
- Exploit natural experiments (Great Recession cohorts, program closures)
- Individual-level difference-in-differences or event studies
- Heterogeneous treatment effects by field, SES, race

**Mechanism Testing:**
- Which components of scarring matter most? (skill atrophy, signaling, networks, debt, psychology)
- Panel data tracking same individuals over 10-20 years post-graduation
- Employer surveys on credential valuation and hiring practices
- Social network analysis of labor market connections

**Intervention Evaluation:**
- Randomized controlled trials of completion supports (advising, financial aid, mentoring)
- Quasi-experimental evaluation of field switching, career counseling, skill training
- Cost-benefit analysis of interventions by population (target high-need students)

**Data Development:**
- Link College Scorecard to UI wage records for long-term trajectories
- Field-specific outcomes by institution, not just institution-level
- Within-institution SES stratification (not just Pell percentage)
- Occupational outcomes, not just earnings (match to O*NET)

## Study Limitations

### Data Constraints

**Institutional Aggregation:**
- Outcomes aggregated to institution level miss within-institution heterogeneity
- Cannot control for individual student characteristics (ability, motivation, family background)
- Selection bias: students sort into institutions based on unobservable characteristics

**Single Time Point:**
- Earnings measured 10 years post-entry misses earlier/later career trajectories
- Cannot observe whether gaps narrow or widen beyond 10 years
- No information on pre-enrollment characteristics or outcomes

**Missing Variables:**
- No data on occupational match quality
- No measures of job satisfaction, underemployment perception
- No information on degree-job alignment
- Limited information on institution resources, teaching quality

### Methodological Limitations

**Descriptive Analysis:**
- Cannot establish causality from correlational patterns
- Confounding from student selection, regional labor markets, cohort effects
- Need IV, DiD, or RCT designs for causal claims

**Attrition Bias:**
- 26% of institutions lack earnings data (often small, specialized, or poor outcomes)
- Non-completers excluded from completion quartile analysis
- Potentially biased estimates if missing data correlated with outcomes

**External Validity:**
- U.S.-specific findings may not generalize internationally
- Time period includes Great Recession (2008-2010) which may amplify scarring
- Cohort effects: patterns may differ for more recent cohorts

### Theoretical Limitations

**Scarring vs. Selection:**
- Cannot fully distinguish scarring from student selection
- High-risk institutions may select students with worse unobservable characteristics
- Even with controls, residual confounding likely

**Simplified Framework:**
- Binary scarring vs. mismatch oversimplifies complex mechanisms
- Reality likely involves both with heterogeneous effects
- Threshold effects, non-linearities not fully explored

## Future Research Directions

### Causal Mechanisms

1. **Instrumental Variables:** Use local unemployment rate at graduation as IV for initial underemployment, estimate effects on long-term earnings

2. **Natural Experiments:** Exploit institution closures, program discontinuations, policy changes (gainful employment rules)

3. **Matched Comparison:** Match high/low-risk institution students on observables, estimate differences in long-term trajectories

4. **Regression Discontinuity:** Exploit admission cutoffs to estimate returns to selective vs. non-selective institutions

### Heterogeneous Effects

1. **Field × SES Interactions:** Do low-SES students face worse outcomes even in high-demand fields?

2. **Race/Ethnicity Disparities:** Intersectionality of race, SES, and institutional quality

3. **Non-Linear Effects:** Threshold effects (e.g., completion only matters above 50%? Earnings only matter above $35K?)

4. **Geographic Variation:** Regional labor market strength moderates institutional effects?

### Intervention Evaluation

1. **Completion Supports:** RCTs of advising, emergency aid, mentoring programs

2. **Career Services:** Experiment with internship requirements, employer partnerships, alumni networks

3. **Field Switching:** Support students to switch from high-risk to high-demand fields

4. **Institutional Accountability:** Quasi-experimental evaluation of gainful employment rules, outcomes-based funding

### Data Development

1. **Linked Administrative Data:** Connect College Scorecard to UI wage records, IRS tax data, NSLDS loan data

2. **Field-Level Outcomes:** Disaggregate to program (CIP code) rather than institution level

3. **Longitudinal Tracking:** Follow same cohorts 5, 10, 15, 20 years post-entry

4. **Occupational Outcomes:** Link to O*NET occupational data to measure degree-job match quality

---

## Conclusions

This analysis provides strong preliminary evidence for the **career "scarring" hypothesis**—initial underemployment creates persistent disadvantages that graduates do not recover from over time. The evidence includes:

- **Large persistent earnings gaps** across institution types ($15,150 for-profit gap)
- **Concentration in high-Pell institutions** where resources and labor market connections are limited
- **Low repayment rates** indicating earnings insufficient for debt service
- **Monotonic SES gradient** suggesting cumulative rather than compensatory mechanisms

These patterns hold across multiple metrics and persist even after 10 years post-enrollment, suggesting structural rather than cyclical factors.

### Policy Priorities

1. **Strengthen for-profit regulation** given systematic underperformance
2. **Increase need-based aid** to offset SES stratification
3. **Incentivize completion** while recognizing it's necessary but not sufficient
4. **Enhance consumer information** so students can make informed choices
5. **Target high-risk fields** for career counseling and labor market information

### Research Priorities

1. **Causal identification** using IV, DiD, or RCT methods
2. **Heterogeneous effects** by field, SES, race to understand mechanisms
3. **Intervention evaluation** to identify cost-effective supports
4. **Data development** linking administrative records for long-term tracking

### Bottom Line

Higher education fails to serve as a universal engine of social mobility. Instead, we observe **stratification and cumulative disadvantage** where low-SES students attend lower-quality institutions in high-risk fields, facing compounding barriers to adequate employment. Without policy intervention, this pattern will persist, widening inequality and undermining the promise of education as a pathway to opportunity.

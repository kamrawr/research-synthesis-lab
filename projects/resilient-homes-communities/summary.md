## Executive Summary

Integrated home retrofit and workforce development programs in rural and underserved communities create sustainable pathways by generating local jobs, serving aging homeowners while training younger workers, and achieving **15-40% energy savings** that support economic resilience, intergenerational equity, and climate adaptation.

Treating homes as community infrastructure—by integrating retrofit, repair, and workforce development—has yielded measurable benefits across economic, social, and environmental domains:

- **Economic resilience:** Several initiatives link home retrofits with workforce training to generate local job creation (one model documented **85 jobs and $5.9 million** in cost savings)
- **Intergenerational equity:** Models that combine home modifications with formal apprenticeships serve older homeowners while creating pathways for younger, marginalized workers
- **Climate adaptation:** Weatherization and efficiency upgrades consistently produce **15-40% energy savings** alongside GHG reductions

## Key Findings

### 1. Community-Based Delivery Models

**Central role of CBOs and partnerships:**
- Community-based organizations, public-private partnerships, and multi-stakeholder collaborations are central to delivering retrofit programs
- 14 studies used partnership, coalition, or multi-partner models
- 6 studies were led by community-based organizations or nonprofits

**Homes as community infrastructure:**
- Programs that treat homes as community infrastructure (rather than isolated private assets) are associated with collective benefits
- Increased resilience, economic stability, and social cohesion documented across multiple sites

**Geographic distribution:**
- 34 studies in the United States (16 urban, 11 rural, 2 tribal contexts)
- California most common (8 studies), followed by Massachusetts (5), Oregon (3), Washington (3)
- 4 international studies (Philippines, Southeast Asia/Eastern Europe, UK, Europe)

### 2. Integrated Workforce Development

**Integration approaches:**
- Many programs integrate workforce development using formal apprenticeships, credentialing, and job placement for at-risk or marginalized populations
- 18 studies measured workforce, jobs, or training outcomes
- Partnerships with educational institutions, unions, and local employers are common

**Economic outcomes:**
- **85 jobs created, $5.9M savings** (Colorado regional collaboration)
- **100+ jobs, $2M savings, 8% internal rate of return** (Southeast Asia/Eastern Europe participatory model)
- **550-750 jobs/year, $120M savings** (Louisville Local Energy Action Program)
- **1.17M jobs** projected (Department of Energy national analysis)

**Workforce challenges:**
- Depth and structure of workforce integration vary across programs
- Some programs lack robust credentialing or long-term career advancement mechanisms
- Limited evidence on wage improvements and sustained employment

### 3. Intergenerational Equity and Age-in-Place

**Dual benefits:**
- Programs combining home modifications with workforce development demonstrate benefits for both older adults and younger workers
- Accessibility improvements, health and safety upgrades support age-in-place outcomes
- 9 studies reported youth or young worker opportunities

**Cultural preservation:**
- In tribal and rural contexts, retrofit programs align with local traditions and values
- Support for cultural preservation and community identity
- 3 studies reported cultural preservation or identity outcomes

### 4. Climate Adaptation Through Housing Resilience

**Energy savings achieved:**
- **15-40% energy savings** range consistently reported
- **19,350 tons CO₂** reduction (Colorado program)
- **33%+ carbon dioxide, 50%+ energy** reduction (Wales government program)
- **40% energy savings** (California whole-house upgrades, rural Southeast Asia)

**Adaptation strategies:**
- Weatherization, disaster preparedness, and resilience upgrades common
- Certification standards (FORTIFIED, Energy Star) and renewable energy installations present in some models
- Improved indoor air quality and reduced asthma rates documented

**Environmental outcomes:**
- 11 studies reported energy savings
- 15 studies reported greenhouse gas or carbon dioxide reduction
- 6 studies reported renewables or solar installations
- 3 studies reported resilience outcomes

### 5. Funding Mechanisms and Policy Frameworks

**Critical policy levers:**
- Federal and state grants, utility incentives, local economic development funds essential for scaling
- Energy efficiency standards and benchmarking ordinances provide additional impetus
- Return on investment documented in 3 studies

**Barriers and solutions:**
- Funding, regulatory complexity, and misaligned financial incentives common barriers
- Successful programs address these through flexible financing, technical assistance, and targeted outreach
- Rural implementation faces barriers related to workforce, funding, and technical capacity

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### Social Outcomes

**Community benefits:**

## Abstract

Black, Indigenous, rural, and low‐income households—including renters in older housing stock—experience **historic disinvestment**, **elevated energy burdens**, and constrained access to clean energy. Papers report energy burdens as high as **16.8% of income** for low-income households (versus 3.5% for the general population), with Black and female-headed renter households bearing disproportionate costs. Studies also document that older homes often require **pre-upgrade repairs**, which exacerbate energy inefficiencies and complicate clean energy improvements.

Programs that combine renewable energy, weatherization, and bill assistance report **energy burden reductions ranging from 10% to 91%**. Successful initiatives frequently center on **trusted community-based organizations (CBOs)** that lead outreach and engagement efforts. 

### Effective strategies include:

1. **Community-based outreach** via door-to-door and peer-to-peer methods
2. **Flexible funding and policy measures**, such as block grants, on-bill tariffs, and alternative credit scoring
3. **Integrated approaches** that blend health and energy upgrades, addressing both structural housing challenges and energy use

These studies indicate that centering lived experiences and partnering with locally trusted CBOs can better align solutions with community needs, support local economies, and help retain benefits within affected communities.

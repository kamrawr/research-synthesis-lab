# Centering Community Needs in Energy Equity

**Author:** Isaiah Kamrar  
**Research Question:** Which types of groups face historic disinvestment, high energy burdens, and limited access to the clean economy? How can social programs serving Black, rural, and low-income households partner with trusted community-based organizations (CBOs) to ensure solutions align with real needs, strengthen local economies, and retain benefits within communities?

**Date:** October 2024  
**Method:** Systematic literature synthesis (Semantic Scholar)  
**Studies Reviewed:** 39 of 500 screened

## Executive Summary

Black, Indigenous, rural, and low-income households face **energy burdens up to 4.8 times higher** than the general population, driven by historic disinvestment, older inefficient housing, and exclusion from clean energy programs. 

**Successful programs demonstrate that energy burden reductions of 10â€“91% are achievable** when:
- **Trusted CBOs lead outreach and engagement**
- **Flexible funding** addresses upfront costs and split incentives
- **Integrated approaches** combine health, housing, and energy
- **Community voice** shapes program design
- **Door-to-door and peer-to-peer** methods build trust
- **Pre-weatherization repairs** are funded
- **Long-term partnerships** are cultivated

## Key Findings

### 1. Energy Burden and Equity Outcomes

**Disproportionate burden:**
- **16.8% of income** for low-income households
- **3.5% of income** for general population
- **4.8x higher burden** for the most vulnerable

**Most affected populations:**
- Black and African-American households
- Female-headed households
- Renters (especially in older housing)
- Indigenous and Native Hawaiian communities
- Rural populations

**Intervention impacts:**
- Energy burden reductions: **10â€“91%**
- Largest reductions in programs combining renewable energy, weatherization, bill assistance, and health interventions

### 2. Community-Based Organization Partnership Models

**Central role of CBOs:**
- Direct service provision (weatherization, home repairs, solar installation)
- Outreach and community engagement
- Advocacy and capacity building
- Cultural brokering and trust-building

**Effective collaboration models:**
- CBOs + local governments + technical experts
- Partnerships based on existing community trust
- Community-led program design and delivery

**Capacity challenges:**
- Staffing and funding limitations
- Technical expertise gaps
- Need for sustained support and investment

### 3. Housing Stock Challenges

**Major barriers:**
- Older, inefficient buildings (pre-1970s construction)
- Poor maintenance and deferred repairs
- Structural issues requiring attention before energy upgrades
- Particularly acute in Black, Indigenous, and rural communities

**Pre-upgrade repair requirements:**
- Lead abatement
- Asbestos remediation
- Roof repairs
- Foundation and structural fixes
- Electrical and plumbing upgrades

**Successful approaches:**
- Integrated health-energy interventions
- Flexible funding (block grants, on-bill financing)
- Landlord incentives (tax credits, rebates, direct grants)

### 4. Community Engagement Strategies

**Centering lived experience:**
- Participatory research and co-design
- Community advisory boards
- Culturally responsive program design

**Effective outreach methods:**
- Door-to-door canvassing
- Peer-to-peer education
- Trusted messengers (faith-based organizations, community leaders)

**Trust-building strategies:**
- Hiring staff reflective of community
- Using local leaders and champions
- Long-term presence and relationship building
- Transparency in decision-making

## Barriers to Program Access

### Financial Barriers
- Upfront costs for upgrades
- Lack of credit or poor credit scores
- Inability to capture incentives for low-income households
- Split incentives in rental housing

### Structural and Policy Barriers
- Regulatory constraints and permitting
- Limited eligibility criteria
- Lack of targeted outreach
- Complex application processes

### Technical Barriers
- Old housing stock requiring extensive repairs
- Lack of modern infrastructure
- Need for pre-upgrade work
- Technical complexity of measures

### Trust and Communication Barriers
- Distrust of government and institutions
- Language barriers
- Lack of awareness about programs
- Past negative experiences

### Systemic Inequities
- Historic disinvestment in communities of color
- Redlining and discriminatory practices
- Exclusion from programs historically
- Environmental injustice and pollution burden

## Best Practices for Implementation

| Practice Category | Implementation Strategy | Community Outcomes |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Community-Based Outreach** | Door-to-door, peer-to-peer, trusted messengers, CBO-led engagement | Increased participation, trust, and satisfaction |
| **Flexible Funding and Policy** | Block grants, on-bill tariffs, landlord incentives, alternative credit scoring | Greater inclusion of low- and moderate-income, renters, and marginalized groups |
| **Integrated Health and Energy** | Holistic housing assessments, combined health and energy upgrades | Improved health outcomes, reduced hospitalizations, increased stability |
| **Capacity Building and Workforce** | Training programs, job creation, technical assistance | Local job growth, increased technical skills, empowered CBOs |
| **Data-Driven and Participatory Design** | Local data use, participatory research, iterative feedback | Programs better aligned with community needs, higher effectiveness |
| **Social Diffusion and Network Strategies** | Leveraging social networks, culturally relevant strategies | Accelerated program uptake, increased awareness |

## Key Implications

### For Policymakers

1. **Address split incentives** in rental housing through tax credits, on-bill financing, and regulatory requirements with support
2. **Flexible funding mechanisms:** Expand block grant eligibility, support on-bill programs, alternative credit scoring
3. **Integrated program design:** Combine energy, health, and housing with pre-weatherization repair funds
4. **CBO partnership support:** Direct funding, capacity building, long-term investment
5. **Equity-centered program design:** Targeted outreach, simplified applications, culturally responsive implementation

### For Utilities and Program Administrators

1. Partner with trusted CBOs for outreach and delivery
2. Simplify enrollment and reduce barriers
3. Provide flexible program options for diverse housing stock
4. Invest in pre-weatherization repairs
5. Use community-based outreach methods
6. Measure and address equity gaps

### For Community-Based Organizations

1. Build internal capacity for technical delivery
2. Develop partnerships with utilities, government, technical experts
3. Center community voice in program design
4. Use peer educators and trusted messengers
5. Document outcomes and advocate for policy change
6. Pursue sustainable funding sources

## Methodology

### Search Strategy
- **Search corpus**: 126 million academic papers (Semantic Scholar)
- **Papers retrieved**: 500
- **Studies included**: 39
- **Focus**: Empirical evidence and CBO partnerships

### Screening Criteria
- Target population: Black, rural, low-income, Indigenous
- Intervention type: Energy efficiency, housing, renewable energy, clean economy
- Community-based approach: CBOs, partnerships, place-based
- Housing context: Existing residential (not new construction)
- Empirical evidence: Quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods

## Limitations

1. **Publication bias:** Positive results likely over-represented
2. **Geographic bias:** Most studies from U.S. context
3. **Program heterogeneity:** Difficult to compare across diverse interventions
4. **Limited long-term data:** Most studies measure short-term outcomes
5. **Causal inference limitations:** Many observational studies

## Future Research Needs

1. Longitudinal studies of energy burden impacts
2. Rigorous evaluation of CBO partnership models
3. Community-level outcome measures (beyond individual)
4. Cost-effectiveness analysis of integrated approaches
5. Scalability assessment of successful models
6. Equity impact evaluation with disaggregated data
7. Housing stock barrier documentation and solutions
8. Trust-building strategy effectiveness
